# Quadratic equation

##### In this project I created a program that solves a quadratic equation

### 0. Program launch
#### To run the program in the terminal you need to write:
```
make all
```
#### Further
```
./main.out
```
#### There are 2 options for the program: test or user
### 0.1 Option - TEST
________
```
options = -DDO_TEST

.......
```
### 0.2 Optoin - USER
```
#options = -DDO_TEST

.......
```

### 1. Program test
______
#### The project folder contains a file with tests. The program reads data from the file and solves the equation.
#### If the response from the file matches the response from the program, then correct:

### 2. Personal use
______
#### The user enters the  coefficientss of the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the program solves the equation and displays the answer (if there are roots, then the value of the roots, if there are no roots, then "No roots", infinity of roots "Infinite number of roots")
